For example, Arch Linux is a distro that comes bundled with the GNU software collection, systemd, and pacman. gnu GNU, or more specifically, GNU coreutils, is a collection of software that allows you to fully interact with your computer. Linux was created after GNU as it has no kernel, which is essential for a computer to run. init An init process is the first process your computer loads when powering on. It is the parent of all processes - it sets them up and manages them. It does things like running background processes, configures hardware et cetera, and makes sure that the computer has come to the state where it\u0026rsquo;s ready for you to use. It stays running the entire time that your computer is on, managing processes as I have stated before and handling errors if they crash. Arch Linux uses systemd, which is an entire suite of software, not just an init system, doing things such as logging and networking. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to manage as everything is in one place, and provides fast boot-up times. iso file An iso file is, generally speaking, an \u0026ldquo;image\u0026rdquo; (or snapshot) of what would be written to something like a CD or drive. However, within the context of this guide, an ISO file is a single file that contains all the data needed to install an operating system. Arch Linux is installed using a live ISO, meaning that the operating system that boots from it is a complete and fully-functional operating system. However, this is only used as an intermediate stage to get Arch Linux installed on to your drive. kernel A kernel is the middleman between programs and hardware. An example of this is the NT kernel, which is what Windows uses. linux Linux is a Unix-like kernel released in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. machine code Machine code (also known as a \u0026lsquo;binary executable\u0026rsquo;, or just \u0026lsquo;binary\u0026rsquo;) is what computers can actually understand and run (or \u0026ldquo;execute\u0026rdquo;) mirror A mirror is essentially a duplicate copy of some data on a master server. Mirrors are kept for two reasons, to have a copy in case something goes wrong on the master server (or, \u0026ldquo;redundancy\u0026rdquo;) and speed. Mirrors are set up on Linux distros to make download speeds faster, because, put simply, the closer you are to a server, the less time it takes to upload and download data. This is why the mirrorlist exists, as really slow download speeds can time out, meaning that your computer will give up after some period of waiting. package manager A package manager is a collection of software that automates the process of installing, updating and deleting software on a computer in a consistent manner. Arch Linux uses pacman (not to be confused with the \u0026rsquo;80s arcade game) which is a rolling release package manager, meaning that software is not released as regular, big updates but rather small and continuous updates delivered frequently. root directory Not to be confused with the root user. The root directory is the furthest back in a file structure you can go. It is where all the branches created from files and folders on your computer originate from. It holds important folders such as /boot/ and /home/. root user Not to be confused with the root directory. The root user is the most powerful user on your computer capable of performing any task with zero restrictions. Regular users can\u0026rsquo;t and shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to run everything as root, because it\u0026rsquo;s too easy to, for example, delete something important that is essential for your OS to function. This is why it\u0026rsquo;s good practice to make a user separate from the root user, and add a password to it so you think more about what you type in to your shell. shell The shell is the text interface that allows you to interact with your computer that surrounds the kernel to hide its intricate details. signature A signature (or a \u0026lsquo;hash signature\u0026rsquo;, or just \u0026lsquo;hash\u0026rsquo;) is a random string of letters assigned to a file that serves as its unique digital fingerprint. A good hashing algorithm (such as SHA-256) produces a unique string of letters for each input it is given, if they are different. This means that it is impossible for a file to be tampered with without producing an extremely different hash. This is why it is important to check the signature of each file you download off the internet with the one given by the software\u0026rsquo;s publisher. source code Source code is what computer programmers write to make computers do things. It needs to be converted into machine code before it can be run (or \u0026ldquo;executed\u0026rdquo;). Programs can either be distributed as source code, meaning that the user has to compile it themselves, or they can be distributed as machine code where no compilation is needed. Both approaches have their upsides and downsides. unix-like Unix is an operating system family that started off at AT\u0026amp;T. It became very influential within academic circles, leading to large-scale adoption by start-up companies leading Unix to fragment into much smaller, similar but mostly mutually incompatible OSes. Among these are MacOS, the BSD operating systems (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD .etc). An operating system is said to be Unix-like if it behaves like a Unix operating system. For this reason, Linux is generally considered to be Unix-like.

However, don\u0026rsquo;t let this scare you, as this guide will cover those things in-depth.\nImportant terminology # Important terminology can be found on the glossary here. Make sure to have a good read of it so you have a good understanding of what I\u0026rsquo;m trying to across in the guide.\nWhat this guide will not cover (as of now) # All the points below are unplanned as of now - but may come sometime in the far future!\nHow to install any unofficial ports of Arch Linux (e.g. Artix, Arch Linux ARM, Arch Linux 32 .etc).

Hit the Windows Key and R on your keyboard at the same time, a dialog like the below should appear on the bottom left of your screen: In it, type cmd.exe, and hit enter. A window like the below should appear: In that, enter the below command: echo %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE% If it returns AMD64, you\u0026rsquo;re all good to go.\nSwitching to Arch from MacOS or another Linux distro?

The safest (and simplest) was to do so is to replace the hashtag with sudo.\n$ before a command means that the command can just be run normally.
