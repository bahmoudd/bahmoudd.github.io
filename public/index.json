For example, Arch Linux is a distro that comes bundled with the GNU software collection, systemd, and pacman. gnu GNU, or more specifically, GNU coreutils, is a collection of software that allows you to fully interact with your computer. Linux was created after GNU as it has no kernel, which is essential for a computer to run. init An init process is the first process your computer loads when powering on. It is the parent of all processes - it sets them up and manages them. It does things like running background processes, configures hardware et cetera, and makes sure that the computer has come to the state where it\u0026rsquo;s ready for you to use. It stays running the entire time that your computer is on, managing processes as I have stated before and handling errors if they crash. Arch Linux uses systemd, which is an entire suite of software, not just an init system, doing things such as logging and networking. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to manage as everything is in one place, and provides fast boot-up times. kernel A kernel is the middleman between programs and hardware. An example of this is the NT kernel, which is what Windows uses. linux Linux is a Unix-like kernel released in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. machine code Machine code (also known as a \u0026lsquo;binary executable\u0026rsquo;, or just \u0026lsquo;binary\u0026rsquo;) is what computers can actually understand and run (or \u0026ldquo;execute\u0026rdquo;) package manager A package manager is a collection of software that automates the process of installing, updating and deleting software on a computer in a consistent manner. Arch Linux uses pacman (not to be confused with the \u0026rsquo;80s arcade game) which is a rolling release package manager, meaning that software is not released as regular, big updates but rather small and continuous updates delivered frequently. source code Source code is what computer programmers write to make computers do things. It needs to be converted into machine code before it can be run (or \u0026ldquo;executed\u0026rdquo;). Programs can either be distributed as source code, meaning that the user has to compile it themselves, or they can be distributed as machine code where no compilation is needed. Both approaches have their upsides and downsides. unix-like Unix is an operating system family that started off at AT\u0026amp;T. It became very influential within academic circles, leading to large-scale adoption by start-up companies leading Unix to fragment into much smaller, similar but mostly mutually incompatible OSes. Among these are MacOS, the BSD operating systems (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD .etc). An operating system is said to be Unix-like if it behaves like a Unix operating system. For this reason, Linux is generally considered to be Unix-like.

This guide will not cover how to install unofficial ports of Arch Linux, such as Artix, Arch Linux ARM or Arch Linux 32. Click on one of the collapsible sections below (depending on your operating system) to check if you have an x86-64 CPU.\nSwitching to Arch from Windows? Hit the Windows Key and R on your keyboard at the same time, a dialog like the below should appear on the bottom left of your screen: In it, type cmd.exe, and hit enter. A window like the below should appear: In that, type echo %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE% and hit enter. If it returns AMD64, you\u0026rsquo;re all good to go.\nImportant terminology # Important terminology can be found on the glossary here. Make sure to have a good read of it so you have a good understanding of what I\u0026rsquo;m trying to across in the guide.\nImportant thing to note # If you see a line like the below: $ ls\nCheck the character in front of it, if it starts with a dollar sign, that means you type everything after the dollar sign, but not the dollar sign itself.\nFor example: $ ls means that you should type ls into your shell, and not $ ls\nIf you see a hash symbol, however, that means you should run the command with elevated privileges. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the Arch ISO (i.e. not the operating system installed on your computer), then you don\u0026rsquo;t need to do anything, type everything after the hash symbol.\nIf Arch Linux is properly installed on your computer, and you are booted into it, you can do one of the two following things:\nRun sudo su in to your shell before typing in to it, this allows you to run any privileged command you want. Make sure you type exit once you\u0026rsquo;re done Or, you can do the better method, which is, substitute the hashtag symbol for the word sudo, so something like:\n# pacman -Syu means that you type sudo pacman -Syu into your shell.
