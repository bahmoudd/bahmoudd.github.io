For example, Arch Linux is a distro that comes bundled with the GNU software collection, systemd, and pacman. gnu GNU, or more specifically, GNU coreutils, is a collection of software that allows you to fully interact with your computer. Linux was created after GNU as it has no kernel, which is essential for a computer to run. init An init process is the first process your computer loads when powering on. It is the parent of all processes - it sets them up and manages them. It does things like running background processes, configures hardware et cetera, and makes sure that the computer has come to the state where it\u0026rsquo;s ready for you to use. It stays running the entire time that your computer is on, managing processes as I have stated before and handling errors if they crash. Arch Linux uses systemd, which is an entire suite of software, not just an init system, doing things such as logging and networking. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to manage as everything is in one place, and provides fast boot-up times. kernel A kernel is the middleman between programs and hardware. An example of this is the NT kernel, which is what Windows uses. linux Linux is a Unix-like kernel released in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. machine code Machine code (also known as a \u0026lsquo;binary executable\u0026rsquo;, or just \u0026lsquo;binary\u0026rsquo;) is what computers can actually understand and run (or \u0026ldquo;execute\u0026rdquo;) mirror A mirror is essentially a duplicate copy of some data on a master server. Mirrors are kept for two reasons, to have a copy in case something goes wrong on the master server (or, \u0026ldquo;redundancy\u0026rdquo;) and speed. Mirrors are set up on Linux distros to make download speeds faster, because, put simply, the closer you are to a server, the less time it takes to upload and download data. This is why the mirrorlist exists, as really slow download speeds can time out, meaning that your computer will give up after some period of waiting. package manager A package manager is a collection of software that automates the process of installing, updating and deleting software on a computer in a consistent manner. Arch Linux uses pacman (not to be confused with the \u0026rsquo;80s arcade game) which is a rolling release package manager, meaning that software is not released as regular, big updates but rather small and continuous updates delivered frequently. root directory Not to be confused with the root user. The root directory is the furthest back in a file structure you can go. It is where all the branches created from files and folders on your computer originate from. It holds important folders such as /boot/ and /home/. root user Not to be confused with the root directory. The root user is the most powerful user on your computer capable of performing any task with zero restrictions. Regular users can\u0026rsquo;t and shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to run everything as root, because it\u0026rsquo;s too easy to, for example, delete something important that is essential for your OS to function. This is why it\u0026rsquo;s good practice to make a user separate from the root user, and add a password to it so you think more about what you type in to your shell. shell The shell is the text interface that allows you to interact with your computer that surrounds the kernel to hide its intricate details. source code Source code is what computer programmers write to make computers do things. It needs to be converted into machine code before it can be run (or \u0026ldquo;executed\u0026rdquo;). Programs can either be distributed as source code, meaning that the user has to compile it themselves, or they can be distributed as machine code where no compilation is needed. Both approaches have their upsides and downsides. unix-like Unix is an operating system family that started off at AT\u0026amp;T. It became very influential within academic circles, leading to large-scale adoption by start-up companies leading Unix to fragment into much smaller, similar but mostly mutually incompatible OSes. Among these are MacOS, the BSD operating systems (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD .etc). An operating system is said to be Unix-like if it behaves like a Unix operating system. For this reason, Linux is generally considered to be Unix-like.

This makes Arch Linux great for gaming, as new updates to GPU drivers and such are installable as soon as they are available. Also, there is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to Arch, especially when it comes to installation and installing apps through pacman. However, don\u0026rsquo;t let this scare you, as this guide will cover those things in-depth.\nImportant terminology # Important terminology can be found on the glossary here. Make sure to have a good read of it so you have a good understanding of what I\u0026rsquo;m trying to across in the guide.\nRequirements # You must have basic technical understanding (i.e. know what \u0026lsquo;hardware\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;software\u0026rsquo; mean) and a x86-64 computer, which your computer likely is. This guide will not cover how to install unofficial ports of Arch Linux, such as Artix, Arch Linux ARM or Arch Linux 32. Click on one of the collapsible sections below (depending on your operating system) to check if you have an x86-64 CPU.\nSwitching to Arch from Windows (or want a dual-boot setup)? Hit the Windows Key and R on your keyboard at the same time, a dialog like the below should appear on the bottom left of your screen: In it, type cmd.exe, and hit enter. A window like the below should appear: In that, enter the below command: echo %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE% If it returns AMD64, you\u0026rsquo;re all good to go.\nSwitching to Arch from MacOS or another Linux distro? On MacOS, open the \u0026ldquo;Terminal\u0026rdquo; application from Finder.\nOn any Linux distribution, open your terminal application. This could be kitty, alacritty, konsole, yakuake .etc.\nIn the shell, enter the below command: uname -m If it returns x86_64, you\u0026rsquo;re all good to go.\nGuide notation # [...] means that there\u0026rsquo;s something between the two or more lines shown in the guide, which have been omitted to narrow the guide\u0026rsquo;s focus.\nAnything else between square brackets means that you should substitute it with what the text reads, for example, [your drive] means that you should substitute [your drive] for the drive that you want to install Arch Linux on to.\nAny text after hashtags explain the command you are running and may be omitted when you type it in.\nThis means that if you see the below in the guide: sfdisk --delete [your drive] # make a backup of your drive before running this command Assuming your drive is /dev/sda, you would type the below command into the shell: sfdisk --delete /dev/sda ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/arch-install-guide/introduction/","section":"Arch Install Guide","summary":"","title":"Introduction","type":"arch-install-guide"},{"content":"","date":"27 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"27 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"The Cove of Bahmoudd","summary":"","title":"The Cove of Bahmoudd","type":"page"},{"content":" What will this site be about # This site is essentially a side project for me to record my thoughts about stuff, which will mostly be about tech and the FOSS world.
