# What will this site be about

This site is essentially a side project for me to record my thoughts about stuff, which will mostly be about tech and the FOSS world. This site may contain unpopular or controversial opinions, so if you're a person who can't cope with that and call everything you disagree with "ragebait", then kindly click off my site. Also, this site will not be a place for tech news, but rather provide commentary on what happens in the tech world, so please don't treat this site as such, as I want everyone to have an informed view of the tech world, instead of just listening to my one-sided two cents on it.
