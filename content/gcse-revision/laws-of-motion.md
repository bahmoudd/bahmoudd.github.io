Newton's laws of motion are three laws that describe the relationship between an object and the forces acting on it.\
These laws are:
1) <u>__An object remains in the same state of motion unless a force acts on it.__</u>\
This means:
    * A stationary object remains stationary unless a force is applied to it
    * A moving object continues moving at the same velocity (at the same speed and in the same direction.)
2) <u>__The force of an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by how much the object is accelerating__</u>\
This is shown by the equation below:
$$ 
\let\force=f \let\mass=m \let\acceleration=a
\force = \mass\acceleration 
$$

    For example:

    A car which weighs 1,000 kilograms, accelerating at 5 metres per second squared, have an overall force of 5,000 Newtons acting on it. 

3) <u>__Whenever two objects interact, they exert equal forces on each other in opposite directions.__</u>

    Example:

    A man is pushing a car.\
    The car pushes the man back (so the man's hands don't go through the car.)
