A "distro" (or [_Linux_](./linux) distribution) is a bundle of software including a fully-configured copy of the Linux kernel, and other software which allow applications to run. For example, Arch Linux is a distro that comes bundled with the GNU software collection, systemd, and pacman (a means of downloading software). You don't have to worry about what GNU and systemd do, just know that they allow apps to run on your computer.
