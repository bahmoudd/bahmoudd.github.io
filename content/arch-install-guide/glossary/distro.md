A "distro" (or [_Linux_](./linux) distribution) is a bundle of software including a fully-configured copy of the Linux kernel, and other software which allow applications to run. For example, Arch Linux is a distro that comes bundled with the [_GNU software collection_](./gnu), [_systemd_](./init), and [_pacman_](./package-manager).
