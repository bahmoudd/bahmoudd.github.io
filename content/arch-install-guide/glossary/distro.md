*A "distro"* (or [_Linux_](/arch-install-guide/glossary/linux) distribution) is a bundle of software including a fully-configured copy of the Linux kernel, and other software which allow applications to run. For example, Arch Linux is a distro that comes bundled with the [_GNU software collection_](/arch-install-guide/glossary/gnu), [_systemd_](./init), and [_pacman_](/arch_install-guide/glossary/package-manager).
