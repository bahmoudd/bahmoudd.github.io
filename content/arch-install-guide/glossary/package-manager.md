A _package manager_ is a collection of software that automates the process of installing, updating and deleting software on a computer in a consistent manner. Arch Linux uses _pacman_ (not to be confused with the '80s arcade game) which is a rolling release package manager, meaning that software is not released as regular, big updates every once in a while, but rather, small and continuous updates delivered frequently.
