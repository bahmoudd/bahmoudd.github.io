A package manager is a collection of software that automates the process of installing, updating and deleting software on a computer in a consistent manner. Arch Linux uses *pacman* (not to be confused with the '80s arcade game) which is a rolling release package manager, meaning that software is not released as regular, big updates but rather small and continuous updates delivered frequently.
