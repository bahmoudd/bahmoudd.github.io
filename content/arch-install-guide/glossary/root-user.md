Not to be confused with the [_root directory_](./root-directory). The root user is the most powerful user on your computer capable of performing any task with zero restrictions. Regular users can't and shouldn't be able to run everything as root, because it's too easy to, for example, delete something important that is essential for your OS to function. This is why it's good practice to make a user separate from the root user, and add a password to it so you think more about what you type in to your [_shell_](./shell).
