*Unix* is an operating system family that started off at AT&T. It became very influential within academic circles, leading to large-scale adoption by start-up companies leading Unix to fragment into much smaller, similar but mostly mutually incompatible OSes. Among these are MacOS, the BSD operating systems (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD .etc). An operating system is said to be Unix-like if it behaves like a Unix operating system. For this reason, Linux is generally considered to be Unix-like.
