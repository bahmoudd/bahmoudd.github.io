_Unix_ is an operating system family that started off at AT&T. It became very influential within academic circles, leading to large-scale adoption by start-up companies, leading Unix to fragment into much smaller, similar but mostly mutually incompatible OSes. Among these are MacOS and the BSD operating systems (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD .etc). An operating system is said to be Unix-like if it behaves like a Unix operating system. For this reason, Linux is generally considered to be Unix-like. The reason why Linux is Unix-like and not Unix is because it is commonly paired with GNU, which stands for "GNU's Not Unix".
