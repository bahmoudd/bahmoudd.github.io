_Source code_ is what computer programmers write to make computers do things. It needs to be converted into [_machine code_](/arch-install-guide/glossary/machine-code) before it can be run (or "executed").
Programs can either be distributed as source code, meaning that the user has to [_compile_](/arch-install-guide/glossary/compilation) it themselves, or they can be distributed as machine code where no compilation is needed. Both approaches have their upsides and downsides. Source code distributions means that the user has to compile the code, meaning that your program suddenly has a learning curve attached to it. Machine code distributions mean that your program now only works for one kind of machine and operating system (for example, if you compile your program on an x64 Linux machine, the machine code binary will only work other x64 Linux machines).
