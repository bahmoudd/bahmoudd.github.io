*Source code* is what computer programmers write to make computers do things. It needs to be converted into [_machine code_](/arch-install-guide/glossary/machine-code) before it can be run (or "executed").
Programs can either be distributed as source code, meaning that the user has to [_compile_](/arch-install-guide/glossary/compilation) it themselves, or they can be distributed as machine code where no compilation is needed. Both approaches have their upsides and downsides.
