A _compatibility layer_ is a piece of software that converts an interaction between Software A and Software B into an interaction between Software A and Software C. Wine is an example of a compatibility layer, because it translate Windows NT [_kernel_](/arch-install-guide/glossary/kernel) calls into [_Linux_](/arch-install-guide/glossary/linux) kernel calls.
