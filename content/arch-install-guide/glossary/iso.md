An _iso file_ is, generally speaking, an "image" (or snapshot) of what would be written to something like a CD or drive. However, within the context of this guide, an ISO file is a single file that contains all the data needed to install an operating system. Arch Linux is installed using a live ISO, meaning that the operating system that boots from it is a complete and fully-functional operating system. However, this is only used as an intermediate stage to get Arch Linux installed on to your drive.
