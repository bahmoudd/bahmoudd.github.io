_Firmware_ is the computer software that provides low-level control for a device's specific hardware. When the term _"firmware"_ is used, it's typically used to mean the UEFI of a system, which is the very first thing your computer runs when it turns on. It initialises (meaning "prepares") your hardware so that the bootloader can take over.
