A _signature_ (or a 'hash signature', or just 'hash') is a random string of letters assigned to a file that serves as its unique digital fingerprint. A good hashing algorithm (such as SHA-256) produces a unique string of letters for each input it is given, if they are different. This means that it is impossible for a file to be tampered with without producing an extremely different hash. This is why it is important to check the signature of each file you download off the internet with the one given by the software's publisher.
