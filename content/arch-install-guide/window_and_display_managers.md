### What is a window manager?

Put simply, a window manager organises your windows and decides how GUI elements are placed.\
There are two main types of Window Managers (WMs):
- Stacking Window Managers (SWMs)
- Tiling Window Managers (TWMs)

An SWM is your vanilla window manager. You use your mouse to stack, arrange and rearrange windows. There's normally a system tray, and a button to minimise all apps to it.

A TWM is a bit more advanced tham an SWM. Their main focus is to increase productivity by keeping your hands on the keyboard.\
â†’ There's keybinds for all functions, however, they have a much steeper learning curve.

### My advice?

Use a stacking window manager if you use the Nano text editor, and use a tiling window manager if you use Vim, Neovim or Emacs.

### Different SWMs

This section will cover Stacking Window Managers.

### Installing a display manager

Now that you have installed a window manager, you will need to install a [_display manager_](/arch-install-guide/glossary/greeter).\
There are two main greeters in Arch Linux: sddm and gdm.

If you have installed GNOME as your desktop environment, install and enable GDM as shown below:
```
# pacman -S gdm
# systemctl enable gdm.service
```
If you have installed any other window manager, install and enable SDDM as shown below:
```
# pacman -S sddm
# systemctl enable sddm.service
```

### Setting up sound on Linux

{{< notice note >}}
This step is optional, but allows you to enjoy bluetooth and configuring sound devices on your computer.
{{< /notice >}}

Below is a command that installs a bunch of applications somewhat relating to sound
```
# pacman -S alsa-utils bluez bluez-utils pipewire wireplumber pipewire-alsa pipewire-pulse
```

Packages       | Description
-------------- | -----------------------------------------
alsa-utils     | Allows you to configure sound devices in the terminal
bluez          | Provides bluetooth functionality
bluez-utils    | Allows you to configure bluetooth in the terminal
pipewire       | Audio and video server for Linux. Allows you to screen-capture and provides desktop sound
wireplumbler   | Tells PipeWire what to do with audio and video devices
pipewire-alsa  | Provides sound drivers
pipewire-pulse | A compatibility layer that allows legacy PulseAudio apps to work on PipeWire

Then, enable bluetooth, as shown below:
```
# pacman -S bluetooth.service
```

If at any point, you experience sound issues when running Wine applications, you may need to install an audio driver package as shown below:
```
# pacman -Syu lib32-alsa-lib lib32-alsa-plugins lib32-pipewire
```

Now, installation is fully complete. For some quality-of-life features, check out the `extras` page.\
To enjoy graphics on Arch, run the below command:
```
$ reboot
```
