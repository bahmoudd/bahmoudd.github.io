# Requirements

You must have basic technical understanding (i.e. know what 'hardware' and 'software' mean)

# Important terminology

{{< details summary="What is source code?" >}}
Source code is what computer programmers write to make computers do things. It differs from machine code because machine code is the language that computers can actually understand. Software is must be converted from source code to machine code before being run (or 'executed')

{{< details summary="What does FOSS mean?" >}}
FOSS means Free and Open-Source Software. A FOSS program is a program that meets 4 characteristics:
* It must be able to be run by anyone as they wish
* Its contents must be available to everyone, and anyone may access the source code to study how it works, and anyone can tinker with their own copy of the source code however they wish
* It can be freely distributed by anyone, regardless of who they are
* If anyone does decide to tinker with their copy of the source code, they must be able to freely distribute it to others so everyone benefits from the changes that they have made with their copy of the source code.

This is significant because it means that if a FOSS program doesn't work or lacks something, you can freely modify the program to work or include said functionality.

{{< details summary="What is Linux?" >}}
A kernel is essentially a program that sits between your apps and your hardware. Windows, for example, uses something called the NT kernel. What makes the Linux kernel stand out from the others, is that, unlike the NT kernel, Linux is completely FOSS.
