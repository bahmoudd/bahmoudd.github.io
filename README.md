## Colour scheme

This website uses a custom blowfish colour scheme, generated by [_fugu_](https://github.com/nunocoracao/fugu) from the following colours:
* #4c4f69 for the header colour 
* #1e66f5 for the footer colour
* #04a5e5 for the accent colour

## Note

The comment section might not look right at first. To fix this, simply toggle the light/dark mode selector. I have no idea how to fix this in a way that will allow me to change giscus's theme when the site's theme changes.
